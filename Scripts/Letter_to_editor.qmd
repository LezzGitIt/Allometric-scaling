# Instructions from Nature communications 

'Avoid repeating information that is already present in the abstract and introduction'

Perspectives require a synopsis, which should outline the basic structure of the article; list the material to be covered with an indication of the proposed depth of coverage; indicate how the material will be logically arranged; and list some of the key references that will be included. The synopsis should be accompanied by a 300-500 word outline of the background to the topic which summarises the progress made to date and gives the rationale and timing for considering the Perspective.

# Letter to editor

To whom it may concern, \
\
Thank you for your consideration of my article 'Beyond Bergmann and Allen: A Unified Framework for Thermoregulatory Morphology'. Within, I propose a new ecogeographical rule, the 'Thermo-Morpho Rule', which views size and shape as complementary axes of thermoregulatory adaptation. The rule calls for the unification of Bergmann's and Allen's rules, as both are governed by the same biophysical principle – that surface area to volume ratios mediate heat exchange.

# Synopsis

I begin with a review of the literature in the last 5 years to determine how often Bergmann's and Allen's rules have been analyzed in concert vs. in isolation. Of 83 papers that met the criteria for inclusion, nearly half (49%) analyzed Bergmann's and Allen's rules in isolation, highlighting the need for a unified approach. I then highlight what we risk by analyzing these rules in isolation – drawing heavily on 2 recent papers published in *Nature Communications* \[@frohlichAllometryRevealsTradeoffs2023; @baldwinComplementarityAllensBergmanns2023\], as well as the broader literature. I argue that we may miss 1) trade-offs - where the studied trait (e.g., body size) is functionally constrained and thus, it doesn't respond to temperature; 2) complementarity - combined changes to size and shape that together amount to important adjustments to the surface area–to–volume ratio, and finally, 3) interactions - codependency between size and shape that jointly determine organismal response across temperature gradients. I also stress that the potential for trade-offs, complementarity, and interactions is not restricted to morphology, but has co-evolved along with physiology, coloration, phenology, and behavior to meet thermoregulatory needs [e.g. trade-offs in @briscoeBergmannMeetsScholander2015; complementarity in @he2023global; and interactions in @playa-montmanyBehaviouralPhysiologicalResponses2023].

Thus, a natural next step is to formalize a broader Thermo-Adaptive Framework, encompassing any adaptive thermoregulatory approach. The Thermo-Adaptive Framework is best viewed as a conceptual framework that can help raise awareness of trade-offs, complementarity, and interactions amongst adaptive thermoregulatory approaches. It is not an explicit rule that can be tested in the way that the Thermo-Morpho rule could be. I conclude by highlighting an integrated modeling framework that jointly estimates Bergmann’s and Allen’s rules and can be extended to include additional traits, providing a practical path toward studying thermal adaptation across multiple axes.

# Background 

Several important reviews cover adherence (and lack thereof) to Bergmann's rule [@ashtonPatternsWithinSpeciesBody2002], potential mechanisms [@yom-tovRecentSpatialTemporal2011], and implications in the face of climate change [@gardnerDecliningBodySize2011; @teplitskyClimateWarmingBergmanns2014], although there is little conducted recently [but see @theriotHarnessingNaturalHistory2023]. @rydingShapeshiftingChangingAnimal2021 is an excellent review of Allen's rule and its applications in the Anthropocene, while @guoApplyingBergmannsRule2025 discusses conservation applications of Bergmann's rule. There have been several empirical global tests of Bergmann's rule \[e.g. @he2023global; @skinnerEnvironmentalGeographicConditions2025\], Allen's rule [e.g. @alhajeriGlobalTestAllens2020], and recent large-scale work that has jointly analyzed Bergmann's and Allen's rules [@frohlichAllometryRevealsTradeoffs2023; @baldwinComplementarityAllensBergmanns2023; @youngfleshAbioticConditionsShape2022].

Given their shared thermoregulatory basis, some authors have discussed the interrelatedness of ecogeographical rules [e.g., @ashtonAreEcologicalEvolutionary2001, @gastonEcogeographicalRulesElements2008], but none have explicitly argued for their joint and integrated analysis. On the other hand, recent empirical work has called for their joint analysis [@frohlichAllometryRevealsTradeoffs2023; @baldwinComplementarityAllensBergmanns2023], providing extremely compelling evidence for the existence of trade-offs, complementarity, and interactions at large spatial and taxonomic scales. However, these papers were published at (roughly) the same time, and did not build upon each other's findings, or leverage the broader literature to provide a unifying thermal-morphological framework.

The present Perspective aims to address this gap by highlighting 1) the current isolated treatment of Bergmann's and Allen's rules, 2) the conceptual importance of a joint approach, 3) how the concepts of trade-offs, complementarity, and interactions extend beyond morphology, and 4) a model that jointly estimates Bergmann's and Allen's rules while simultaneously addressing several long-standing issues in studies of morphology-environment relationships. To date, no review has examined how often Bergmann's and Allen's rules have been studied together, or proposed a unified framework linking size, shape, and thermoregulatory capacity. In doing so, this work highlights both the conceptual disconnect in the literature and the analytical opportunities of studying multiple traits jointly in a warming world.

# Questions for the editor

If the editors think this paper has potential for publication in *Nature communications*, I seek their guidance regarding formatting of the final paper. The current paper has elements of a review, perspective, comment, or even a 'matters arising' piece [given the important contributions from @frohlichAllometryRevealsTradeoffs2023 and @baldwinComplementarityAllensBergmanns2023]. Would the manuscript be best positioned as a short Perspective, or would a condensed Comment or Matters Arising format be more suitable?

If the editors believe a longer Perspective would be appropriate, I am open to expanding the manuscript to include:

1.  a quantitative synthesis of how frequently recent studies test for trade-offs, complementarity, or interactions between size and shape;

2.  an assessment of how frequently studies extend analyses to physiology, coloration, phenology, and behavior;

3.  discussion of data and design needs to test the Thermo-Morpho Rule and the broader Thermo-Adaptive Framework (e.g., intra- vs inter-specific scales);

4.  an expanded integrated modeling framework (including formal notation); and

5.  a synthesis of conservation implications.

Alternatively, if these additions move the work beyond the scope of a Comment or Matters Arising piece, I would be happy to streamline or remove the “Integrated Model” section accordingly.
