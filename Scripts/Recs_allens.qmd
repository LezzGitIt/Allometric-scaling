# Abstract

**Background:** Morphological shifts in wildlife are among the most visible biological responses to climate change. While biogeographic rules like Bergmann’s and Allen’s offer longstanding hypotheses for how body size and shape vary with temperature, the statistical tools used to test these rules have lagged behind conceptual advances in allometry and measurement error modeling.

**Aims:** I review common statistical approaches for examining relative appendage length (used to test Allen’s rule) and evaluate their assumptions and limitations. These include the use of trait ratios, residual-based sequential regressions, and body size as a covariate. Drawing on allometric scaling theory, I argue that many widely used “classical” regression models rest on unrealistic assumptions about measurement error, which lead to biased estimates and likely underestimation of morphological responses to warming.

**Recommendations:** For studies examining body shape (e.g., relative appendage length in Allen’s rule), I recommend: (1) tying multiple morphological metrics together at the level of the individual, (2) avoiding ratios due to interpretational and statistical limitations, (3) using models that account for measurement error in both variables - such as standardized major axis (SMA) regression or hierarchical measurement-error models - and (4) where possible, collecting repeated measurements to support explicit modeling of uncertainty.

**Conclusions:** Integrating statistical approaches that respect allometric scaling and measurement uncertainty will yield more accurate inferences about morphological adaptation. This is critical for understanding how wildlife are responding to a warming world - and whether we are currently underestimating those responses.

# Introduction {#sec-Conceptual-background}

Body shape - the proportional relationship among morphological traits - is one of the most fundamental determinants of an organism’s ecology. It influences thermoregulation, locomotion, feeding performance, life history, and niche differentiation. In macroecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation science alike, researchers are often interested in how shape varies across environmental gradients, life history traits, or phylogenetic history.

Yet body shape is surprisingly hard to quantify. Unlike body size, which can often be approximated by a single metric (e.g., mass, snout-vent length in reptiles, body length, tarsus length in birds), shape is inherently multivariate. It emerges from the *covariance* among traits (e.g., bill depth relative to head width), HELP HERE Attempts to measure shape using simple ratios or linear corrections often fail to capture this structure, and may lead to biased or uninterpretable results (DELETE THIS SENTENCE?)

A prime example of this challenge is Allen’s rule, which predicts that endotherms have longer appendages in warmer environments to facilitate heat dissipation. This rule is often invoked in studies of climate-induced morphological change, and is widely supported in endotherms - across both space and time, and among diverse taxa, regions, life-history strategies (e.g., migration and hibernation), and in intra- and inter- specific applications [@rydingShapeshiftingChangingAnimal2021; @rydingLongShorttermResponses2024; @mcqueenThermalAdaptationBest2022]. However, since appendage length generally scales with body size [@raynerFormFunctionAvian1988, @shingletonAllometryStudyBiological2010, @wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006] isolating shape-specific responses requires models that accurately partition variation in size vs shape (CITE Ryding, 2025).

To evaluate how different methods operationalize “relative” trait size, I reviewed recent studies testing Allen’s rule. I found three commonly used methodological / statistical approaches, each of which attempts to isolate body shape by controlling for body size. These approaches differ in important ways, one key assumption shared by all three approaches is that body size is measured without error. I argue that this assumption is violated in studies of body shape, which leads to a biased understanding of environment-morphology relationships. I emphasize that the challenges associated with measuring body shape are not unique to Allen’s rule, and that similar issues arise when examining shape across habitat, land-use change, or urban-wild gradients (e.g., CITE). But Allen’s rule provides an ideal test case as it is widely studied and has important implications for wildlife response to climate change [@rydingShapeshiftingChangingAnimal2021; @goldenbergLinkBodySize2022].

I conducted a literature review of studies since 2021 [when @rydingShapeshiftingChangingAnimal2021 published their influential review] examining the statistical and methodological approaches employed to test for Allen's rule. Briefly, I searched for papers using the keywords Allen\* OR relative appendage length OR climate change OR temperature OR appendage OR limb OR body shape OR thermoregulation OR. I also examined the references for additional papers published between 2021 - 2025. In total, I scored 24 papers meeting the criteria (supplementary table 1). I identified three primary approaches that authors have employed to understand how *relative* appendage length varies with respect to geography or climate: 'body size as a covariate' in multivariate regression (`r Per_approaches[1]`% of studies), a two-step residual regression (`r Per_approaches[2]`%), ratios (`r Per_approaches[3]`%), and other (`r Per_approaches[4]`%).

While the focus of this literature review is on *relative* appendage length, I acknowledge that some authors have used absolute appendage size (i.e., out of the context of body size) to test Allen's rule [e.g., @fanBergmannsRuleAllens2019], which may be appropriate in certain contexts. For example, in appendages that play a primary role is thermoregulation, the absolute appendage size may be more important to heat dissipation capacity than relative appendage size [e.g., bird bills: @tattersallEvolutionAvianBill2017; @symondsGeographicalVariationBill2010; @baldwinComplementarityAllensBergmanns2023; elephant ears: CITE]. The interpretation of absolute appendage size is challenging, as most species will show positive covariance between appendage length and body size [@shingletonAllometryStudyBiological2010; @nte-allometry]. Thus, changes in absolute appendage size may be due to a change in overall body size (consistent with Bergmann's rule) or more directly due to the thermoregulatory properties of the given appendage [as argued by @baldwinComplementarityAllensBergmanns2023]. Interpretation aside, using absolute appendage length is simple from a methodological standpoint, so the rest of this review will be focused on relative appendage length.

## Three common approaches

To understand the effect of temperature on relative appendage size, authors have primarily used three approaches:

1)  Ratio approach: Use the ratio of appendage length to body size as the response variable $$
    \frac{Appendage}{\mathit{Body\ size}} \sim \mathit{Temperature\ increase}
    $$ {#eq-ratios}

2)  'Two-step residual regression' approach: Using the residuals from an initial regression model as the response variable in a second model

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Model 1: } & \text{Appendage} \sim \mathit{Body\ size} \\
\text{Model 2: } & \text{Residuals}_{\text{mod1}} \sim \mathit{Temperature\ increase}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-two-step}

3)  'Body size as a covariate' approach: Include a metric of body size as a covariate in models predicting appendage length\
    $$
    Appendage \sim \mathit{Body\ size} + \mathit{Temperature\ increase}
    $$ {#eq-size-as-cov}

Approaches 2 and 3 are conceptually similar and share a key assumption – that the independent variable *body size* is measured without error while the response variable *appendage* contains all the measurement error. Hereafter, I will refer to any methodological approach assuming that all measurement error lies in the response variable as 'classical regression' approaches.

Note that all three approaches link appendage length and body size together at the *level of the individual* in an attempt to control for body size, in theory measuring the changes in *relative* appendage length. Theoretically, this makes sense as species evolve entire body plans in concert, and thus body features do not change independently of one another. And compared with running separate models of appendage length and body size (e.g., as is frequently done in studies of Bergmann's rule), measuring relative appendage length at the level of the individual should provide more sensitive metrics. For example, if species exhibit small decreases in mass and simultaneous small increases in appendage length, these changes may be deemed unimportant if analyzed in isolation (e.g., Skinner et al. 2025) despite representing a meaningful change in body shape [e.g., @jirinecMorphologicalConsequencesClimate2021; @dubinerWidespreadRecentChanges2022]. Thus, individual-level metrics of body shape provide us the most statistical power to detect environment-morphology relationships.

## Allometric scaling in studies assessing relative appendage length

Allometry is the study of how biological processes change with body size. Seminal work by CITE Huxley formulated that the scaling relationship between an appendage $Y$ and body size $X$ follows a power-law, where

$$
Y = \alpha * X^\beta
$$

On the log scale this function becomes additive

$$
log(Y) = log(\alpha) + \beta * log(X)\
$$

where $log(\alpha)$ determines the average relative appendage length for a given body size (the allometric intercept), and $\beta$ determines the rate that the appendage increases with an increase in body size [the allometric slope, @shingletonAllometryStudyBiological2010].

Allometric scaling theory posits that proportional growth of two linear features should increase linearly ($\beta$ = 1), whereas proportional growth of a linear feature and volume should scale inverse cubically ($\beta = 1/3$ i.e. given that organismal volume is three-dimensional, [@raynerFormFunctionAvian1988]). When empirical reality matches theoretical expectations, this is known as isometric scaling [@shingletonAllometryStudyBiological2010]. If the allometric slope exceeds that expected by theory (e.g. $\beta > 1/3$), this is known as hyperallometry (or positive allometry), and when it is is less than expected by theory (e.g. $\beta < 1/3$), this is known as hypoallometry. Importantly, isometric scaling implies that body *shape* remains constant as body size increases, whereas hyper- and hypo- allometry suggest changes in body proportions.

There has been confusion in the literature regarding the term allometry due to a general and a stricter interpretation of the term allometry. Some authors have used it loosely to refer to any monotonic relationship between body size and some trait [CITE PELABON, 2014] This has created tension in the context of examining relative appendage length, where some have @santoroAllometryEvaluateAllens2022 argue that we must base our methods in allometric scaling theory through the power-law relationship proposed by [CITE HUXLEY], and imply that only certain types of regression (e.g., SMA regression) appropriately address allometric scaling [@wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006]. In a rebuttal by @rydingResponseAllometryEvaluate2022, they argue that the 'standard practice approach' of including body size as a covariate in multiple regression is 'effectively equivalent' to more 'detailed allometric investigations.' I agree with both sets of authors in that 1) any approach examining appendage length relative to body size does (at least somewhat) address allometric scaling [as implied by @rydingResponseAllometryEvaluate2022], but 2) methods that account for measurement error in $X$ are more robust (in most situations) than methods that ignore this measurement error [@santoroAllometryEvaluateAllens2022].
:::

### Ratios

The simplest approach to obtain a measure of relative appendage length is to take the ratio of *body size : appendage length* or vice versa (used in \`r . We found that most studies used mass (volumetric) to represent body size and a linear metric of appendage length, as there are some conceptual benefits to this approach. For example, @jirinecMorphologicalConsequencesClimate2021 note that *mass : wing* ratios are proportional to wing loading (mass:wing area) as long as there is no change in wing shape with body size. Other authors have squared a linear metric (e.g., $\text{wing length}^2 \text{or body length}^2$) and divided by mass to represent the surface-area to volume ratio [@dubinerWidespreadRecentChanges2022; @nwaoguTemperatureAridityDetermine2018]. This is appealing as both Bergmann’s and Allen's rule were theorized with respect to changes in surface-area to volume ratios inherent in biological scaling, however it is unclear how well these measurements reflect an animal’s true surface-area to volume ratio. Furthermore, these ratios can be challenging to interpret, as the 1) separation of Bergmann’s vs. Allen's rule is muddled (especially with $\text{appendage}^2$ / mass), and 2) ratios can be interpreted as indicators of body condition [i.e., how much mass or fat stores does an organism have for a given structural size, see @peigParadigmBodyCondition2010 for a summary]. Most important from a practical perspective, ratio approaches are often highly correlated with body size [@greenMassLengthResiduals2001; @jakobEstimatingFitnessComparison1996] and thus provide little information on animal *shape*. Thus, I counsel against the use of ratios as indicators of body shape for both practical and interpretive reasons.

### Classical regression approaches

The 'Two-step residual regression' and 'Body size as a covariate' approaches are closely related. In fact, when predictor variables — namely 'body size' and 'temperature increase' in @eq-two-step and @eq-size-as-cov above — are uncorrelated, these two approaches will yield nearly identical results [@freckletonMisuseResidualsEcology2002]. However, as correlation between these predictors increases, the residual-based approach becomes increasingly biased. This has led most recent studies to favor the 'Body size as a covariate' approach, wherein body size is explicitly included as a predictor of appendage length in a single regression model [e.g., @mcqueenThermalAdaptationBest2022; @rydingLongShorttermResponses2024; @romanoShrinkingBodySize2025].

ONE KEY DIFFERENCE suppression

As mentioned above, the classical regression approaches rely on a foundational assumption that is rarely met in morphological datasets: that the independent variable $X$ is measured without error (CITE ZUUR, 2009). This assumption underlies not only ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but also maximum likelihood and Bayesian models unless the model is explicitly structured to account for uncertainty in both variables. In studies of allometric scaling or relative appendage length, this assumption is clearly violated—measurement error is present in both body size and appendage length. When such error in $X$ is ignored, slope estimates become attenuated, i.e., biased toward zero. This attenuation bias increases as the correlation between $X$ and $Y$ decreases [@nte-linking-ols-sma, @greenMassLengthResiduals2001].

# Statistical approaches better suited to examine body shape

## (Standardized) major axis regression

Alternative types of regression, like standardized major axis (SMA) regression, are better suited for problems of biological scaling as they assume that measurement error is present in both $X$ and $Y$ [@wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006]. The key difference between OLS and SMA regression is how they minimize residuals to generate a line of best fit [see figure 4 in @wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006]. OLS regression minimizes the residuals along the $Y$ axis, whereas SMA regression minimizes the residuals in both $X$ and $Y$ directions (similar to a principal components analysis with just 2 variables). This makes SMA regression well-suited for estimating the true functional relationship between two variables [@greenMassLengthResiduals2001; @wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006; @peigNewPerspectivesEstimating2009; @peigParadigmBodyCondition2010]. SMA regression has rarely been applied to studies seeking to understand the impacts of environmental gradients on body shape [@docampoMarkedReductionBody2019 is an exception], but a recent simulation study by Skinner (2025, *in review*) show that two new approaches leveraging SMA regression can produce unbiased estimates of relative appendage length in a wide variety of hypothetical species that differed in 1) their response to increasing temperatures, and 2) the covariance between appendage length and body size. More research is needed to test these approaches in additional simulation studies as well as against real-world data sets.

::: {#nte-flip-axes .callout-note icon="false"}
## Building intuition for SMA regression

One important feature of SMA regression is that the $X$ and $Y$ axes can be flipped and the line of best fit will not change [also see Figure 1 in @greenMassLengthResiduals2001]. When the axes are flipped, the points are also flipped across the SMA line of best fit (blue), so that each point is equidistant from the line but with the opposite sign (i.e., residuals flip signs). This has some important implications for measures of relative appendage length. Relative to the SMA (blue) regression line, you can see that the individual highlighted in green would be described as having relatively short appendages compared to the other individuals of this hypothetical species (panel A), or as having a large body size for its appendage length (panel B). These are inverse statements, which makes sense for any given individual of our hypothetical species. Comparing the green point to the OLS (red) line, on the other hand, these logical & reciprocal statements do not apply. This convenient property of SMA regression is a function of the residuals being equally and oppositely correlated with both $X$ and $Y$ ($|r_{sma}| = 0.59$ in this hypothetical species). In OLS regression the residuals are not correlated with $X$ but highly correlated with $Y$ ($r_{ols} = 0.96$ in this example).

![In SMA regression the X and Y axes can be flipped and the line of best fit will not change. Here we flip the axes and plot the OLS (red) & SMA (blue) regression lines of best fit, as well as the same individual from our hypothetical species (highlighted in green).](../Figures/sma_flip_axes.png){#fig-sma_flip_axes width="100%"}

## Linking allometric slopes in SMA and OLS regression

There is a direct mathematical link between the slopes of OLS and SMA regression.\
The slope of a predictor variable $X$ (e.g., body size) is related to the response variable $Y$ (e.g., appendage length) in OLS regression via the following equations:

-   $\beta_{ols} = cov[X] / cov[Y]$ OR equivalently

-   $\beta_{ols} = r * \frac{Sy}{Sx}$ where $r$ is the correlation between $X$ and $Y$, and $S$ is the standard deviation

The slopes of OLS and SMA regression are related to each other via the following formula:

-   $\beta_{sma} = sign(r) * \frac{Sy}{Sx}$ , i.e., if $r$ is negative then $\beta_{sma}$ is also negative.

Which is equivalent to:

$$
\beta_{sma} = \beta_{ols} / r
$$

This makes it evident that as $r$ increases, $\beta_{\text{OLS}} \rightarrow \beta_{\text{SMA}}$ and that differences in slopes will be highest when $X$ and $Y$ are only weakly correlated.

![The slopes from SMA and OLS regression are mathematically linked to where $\beta_{sma} = \beta_{ols} / r$, and thus, $\beta_{ols}$ underestimates the true functional relationship between body size and appendage length. The attenuation of $\beta_{ols}$ is greater as $r_{x,y} \rightarrow 0$.](../Figures/corr_sma_ols_slopes.png){#fig-corr_sma_ols_slopes width="100%"}
:::

### Assumptions of SMA

Both classical regression approaches and SMA regression make several assumptions, which can bias results when violated [@greenMassLengthResiduals2001; @arnoldAllometricRelationshipSize2007]. Both regression approaches assume that $X$ and $Y$ are linearly related to each other, and that the residuals are independent, normally distributed, and homoskedastic. As these assumptions are handled extensively elsewhere [CITE Zuur ChX, @wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006], I will only focus on one assumption of SMA regression that has received little attention elsewhere [but see @arnoldAllometricRelationshipSize2007].

SMA regression assumes that the measurement error in $X$ and $Y$ is proportional to the variance of $X$ and $Y$. To accurately estimate the measurement error in $X$ and $Y$, we would ideally have repeated measurements of body size and appendage length [@wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006], but repeated measurements are rarely collected in ecology. An alternative approach is to use the coefficient of variations from the empirical data to estimate the ratio of the errors in $X$ to $Y$ [$\lambda$, @arnoldAllometricRelationshipSize2007]. This assumption is very important and can be responsible for a large amount of variation that authors attribute to allometric scaling — for example, in a review of allometric scaling studies, @arnoldAllometricRelationshipSize2007 found that 84% of the variation in the allometric slope estimates could be explained by the estimated $\lambda$. While it is important to test this assumption empirically (as with any statistical approach), I argue that SMA regression is a better starting point than assuming no measurement error in $X$ in nearly all studies examining relative appendage length.

SMA does not perform well when biological error is present \[CITE HANSEN 2005,

## The hierarchical error model

```{r}
#| label: per-mass-control
mass_control <- Lit_review %>% 
  filter(str_detect(body_size_control, "Mass|mass")) %>% 
  nrow()
per_mass_control <- round(mass_control/nrow(Lit_review) * 100, 0)
```

I argue that both classical regression approaches and the SMA approach make assumptions that can be limiting, and that explicitly modeling the various sources of error influencing our estimates of body size is a more flexible alternative. The two types of error that most commonly creep into estimates of body size relate to observer / instrument error (i.e., measurement error), and transient fluctuations in our *estimate* of body size that do not reflect changes in structural body size \[this has also been called 'biological error', CITE PELABON\]. For example, when using mass as an estimate of body size (as done in `r per_mass_control`% of studies I reviewed), variation due to gut fill, defecation, reproductive or hydration state, etc. do not reflect relevant changes in structural body size, yet will influence mass measurements. If unaccounted for, measurement error and transient fluctuations will be absorbed in the error term of the 'body shape' model (@nte-hierarchical-mod) which will negatively bias our estimate of temperature's impact on body shape ($\beta_T$) due to attenuation [CITE PONZI]. To parse these various types of 'error', repeat measurements of body size from the same individual are required at appropriate temporal windows. For example, consecutive measurements from different observers, measurement devices, or field stations, but of the same subject, can help quantify measurement error, while measurements across a few days can help estimate transient fluctuations in mass. Importantly, in our review only @romanoShrinkingBodySize2025 leveraged repeat measurements within and across individuals to partition extraneous variance unrelated to temperature and body shape. These models imply specific requirements for data collection, such as repeated measurements nested within individuals within and across measurement sessions [see CITE PONZI for specific recommendations].

## Hierarchical model components for decomposing body size variation and estimating shape–environment relationships

This four-level hierarchical model decomposes the observed body mass $X_{ijk}$ of individual $i$ in session $j$ and measurement replicate $k$ into structural size ($Size_i$), within-session biological fluctuations ($\sigma^2_{\text{TF}}$), and measurement error ($\sigma^2_{\text{ME}}$). The hierarchical model estimates temperature's effect on relative appendage length by modeling appendage length $Y_{i}$ as a function of temperature $Temp_i$ and the latent body size ($Size_i$). The table below summarizes each model level.

| **Model name** | **Model equation** | **Repeat measurements needed** |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| Body shape | $Y_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(\alpha + \beta_{S} *  Size_{i} + \beta_T * Temp_i; \sigma^2_Y )$ | Wing measurements across individuals |
| Measurement error | $X_{ijk} \sim \mathcal{N}(X_{ij}; \sigma^2_{\text{ME}})$ | Multiple consecutive mass measurements per session (≥2 per session) |
| Transient fluctuation | $X_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(Size_i; \sigma^2_{\text{TF}})$ | Mass measured in ≥2 sessions per individual |
| Size model | $Size_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu + \gamma_T * Temp_i; \sigma^2_{size})$ | Mass data across individuals and environments |

Where $\gamma_T$ is used to indicate temperature's effect on the persistent (but latent) body size, and $\beta_T$ is the effect we want to accurately estimate (i.e., the effect on relative appendage length). I note that, in certain circumstances, the measurement error and transient fluctuation error models can be combined to estimate a single 'within-session' measurement error term, such that $\sigma^2_{\text{within}}$ = $\sigma^2_{\text{TF}} + \sigma^2_{\text{ME}}$. Indeed, $\beta_T$ will remain unbiased if the noise is randomly structured with respect to temperature, although the uncertainty around our estimates of body size and relative appendage length will increase. Model levels can be extended to include random intercepts or slopes for individual, session, or site as appropriate based on the study design.

# Underestimation of shape-shifting from warming temperatures

Due to the attenuation of $\beta_{ols}$ (@fig-underestimation-ral), I believe that classical regression approaches will underestimate temperatures' impact on relative appendage length in species that adhere to Bergmann's and Allen's rule (or their temporal analogs). The attenuation of $\beta_{ols}$ leads to an overestimation of negative residuals in small individuals (i.e., points in the bottom left quadrant of the plot - labeled with a black "I" in @fig-underestimation-ral), and an overestimation of positive residuals in large individuals (labeled with a black "II" in @fig-underestimation-ral). In species that adhere to Bergmann's rules, temperature increases will select for smaller individuals, pushing individuals towards the bottom left quadrant of the plot (Section I) – exactly where classical regression approaches misclassify individuals as having relatively short appendages (i.e., negative residuals). In other words, classical regression approaches overestimate the amount of individuals with relatively short appendages (Section I), whereas approaches acknowledging measurement error in $X$ (e.g., SMA regression) would more accurately label them as having relatively long appendages.

The SMA line of best fit is shown in blue, and the OLS regression line in red, and the points are colored by how much temperature has increased for a given individual of the hypothetical species.

# Recommendations for examining Allen's rule

-   Quantify body shape using multiple methods and examine the sensitivity of your findings to the various approaches [e.g., @baldwinComplementarityAllensBergmanns2023, @frohlichAllometryRevealsTradeoffs2023]. Examine absolute appendage length as well where appropriate.

-   Acknowledge the measurement error inevitable in both body size and appendage length

    1.  Take repeat measurements and model measurement error explicitly

    2.  Model $X_{true}$ as a latent variable centered around $X_{obs}$

    3.  Approaches leveraging SMA regression are a safer starting place than methods assuming that all measurement error lies in $Y$

-   Examine the relevant assumptions for any statistical approach used.

-   Report coefficients of variation

# Future research

We still lack a clear understanding of how variation in allometric relationships translates into differences in thermoregulatory capacity (but see CITE TOUCAN). Classical regression approaches - such as the 'body size as a covariate' approach - have been favored for their convenience, but they fail to account for error in both the predictor and response variables, and do not align with the theoretical structure of allometric scaling laws. Reanalyzing existing datasets with methods that explicitly allow for error in both $X$ and $Y$, such as structural equation models or hierarchical measurement-error models, would provide more appropriate inference and closer links between empirical data and mechanistic theory.

Future work would also benefit from a unified multivariate index of body shape, i.e., an approach that summarize individual variation across multiple traits simultaneously. Most studies rely on bivariate trait relationships (e.g., body size vs. a single appendage) when examining changes in body shape [but see @baldwinComplementarityAllensBergmanns2023, @frohlichAllometryRevealsTradeoffs2023].

For example, functional trait studies in community ecology commonly use multivariate ordination to map species into a lower-dimensional “morphospace” (CITE PIGOT 2020, Gomez et al 2021, Ali et al 2023); a similar approach applied to individuals could capture coordinated variation in body shape, highlight trade-offs among traits, and quantify the degree to which morphology shifts along environmental gradients. These methods retain the advantages of SMA regression while extending analysis beyond a single size–shape axis, enabling more holistic assessments of shape–climate relationships. One trade-off is that these methods are less intuitive to interpret and require care in trait selection, but their ability to synthesize complex trait variation makes them a promising avenue for future work.

# Conclusions

Understanding how organisms shift their body shape in response to climate change is a critical, yet often methodologically overlooked, component of global change biology. While ecogeographic rules like Allen’s provide useful conceptual starting points, the statistical tools used to quantify morphological change often fail to reflect the biological and measurement realities of shape variation. Classical regression approaches, in particular, rest on unrealistic assumptions about error structure which leads to a systematic underestimation of environmental effects on morphology.

More robust models, utilizing standardized major axis regression or a hierarchical measurement-error framework, offer better inference by respecting allometric principles and acknowledging measurement error. Though motivated here by studies of Allen’s rule, the statistical issues and recommendations raised in this paper apply broadly to any study examining body shape in wildlife. As climate change accelerates, accurately detecting the magnitude with which organisms are altering morphology will require sophisticated methods to keep pace.

# EXTRAS

hierarchical approach that models @subasingheRepeatabilityValidityPhenotypic2021, Carriquiry, 2015, Ponzi et al 2018\]. With repeat measurements $j$ of the morphological trait $X$ from individual $i$ we can obtain an estimate of measurement error ($\sigma_{x,within}$) of $X$. Simple algebra allows us to obtain an estimate of the between-individual variance ($\sigma_{x,between}$). I argue that both classical regression approaches and the SMA approach make assumptions that can be limiting, and that a hierarchical measurement-error framework offers a more flexible and biologically realistic alternative by explicitly modeling measurement error in our predictor ($X$) [@subasingheRepeatabilityValidityPhenotypic2021, Carriquiry, 2015, Ponzi et al 2018].
