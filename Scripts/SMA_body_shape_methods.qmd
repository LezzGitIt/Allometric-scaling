# Abstract

Due to its important implications for wildlife responses to climate change, studies of Allen's rule (i.e., that animals have relatively longer appendages in warmer climates to facilitate thermoregulation) have increased in recent decades. While there is general agreement that warm-blooded animals become longer in warmer climates, the methods used to quantify changes in relative appendage length in response to temperature gradients have varied widely. I conduct a literature review of studies examining Allen's rule since 2021 and find that, in addition to modeling absolute (i.e., not relative) appendage length, authors have taken three main approaches: (1) modeling simple ratios (e.g., appendage:mass) as a function of temperature, (2) modeling appendage length as a function of body size and temperature, and (3) conducting a two-step regression by (3a) modeling appendage length as a function of mass using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and then (3b) modeling the residuals as a function of temperature.

Here, I test whether two new metrics of relative appendage length are able to accurately capture changes in *relative* appendage length due to a simulated temperature increase. Both approaches leverage standardized major axis (SMA) regression, which has been advocated for in applications involving biological scaling. I compare these two new approaches to the three approaches commonly used in the literature using simulated morphological data from 180 hypothetical species that vary in 1) their response to increasing temperatures, and 2) the strength of appendage length–mass covariation. The two approaches leveraging SMA regression accurately capture changes in *relative* appendage length in the vast majority of simulations, although they each fail in specific situations. I find that ratio approaches (approach 1) overestimate the increase in relative appendage length, while 'body size as a covariate' (approach 2) and a two-step OLS (approach 3) underestimate relative appendage length. I find qualitatively similar results in a case study examining relative appendage length across latitudinal gradients in three nightjar species from North America and Europe.

These results show that the methodological approach leveraged to measure relative appendage length can have drastic effects on results. The assumption made by approaches 1 - 3, that all measurement error lies in $Y$, is non-sensical in studies that are inherently about biological scaling. Thus, approaches that acknowledge measurement error in both $X$ and $Y$ (i.e., both SMA approaches presented here) outperform the approaches that are regularly used in the literature. I highlight that alternative approaches where measurement error in $X$ and $Y$ is directly estimated from repeat morphological measurements are more flexible and will perform better in a greater variety of circumstances. However, the two SMA approaches presented here offer easily-implementable alternatives, and would be a great improvement over the methods regularly used to assess shape-shifting in wildlife at present.

# Introduction {#sec-Conceptual-background}

Wildlife appear to be changing their size & shape in response to climate change. Temporal applications of Bergmann's rule predict that body size will decrease with warmer temperatures, while (temporal) Allen's rule claims that appendage length will increase in response to rising temperatures. Thus Allen's rule is about the shape of organisms, and is often interpreted as appendage length *relative* to body size. Framing Allen's rule in terms of *relative* appendage length acknowledges that overall body size and appendage length will often show positive covariance. After conducting a literature review of studies since 2021 [when @rydingShapeshiftingChangingAnimal2021 published their influential review] examining the statistical and methodological approaches employed to test for Allen's rule, I identify three primary approaches that scientists have employed to understand how *relative* appendage length varies with respect to geography or climate. Thus, in addition to modeling absolute appendage length as a function of temperature change, authors have used:

1)  Ratio approach: Use the ratio of appendage length to body size as the response variable\
    $\frac{Appendage}{\mathit{Body\ size}} \sim \mathit{Temperature\ increase}$

2)  'OLS residuals' approach: Using the residuals from an OLS regression model\
    Model 1: $Appendage \sim \mathit{Body\ size}$\
    Model 2: $Residuals_{OLS} \sim \mathit{Temperature\ increase}$

3)  'Body size as a covariate' approach: Include a metric of body size as a covariate in models predicting appendage length\
    $Appendage \sim \mathit{Body\ size} + \mathit{Temperature\ increase}$

All three attempt to control for body size to isolate the changes in *relative* appendage length, but approaches 1 and 2 are known to frequently produce biased results. The ratio approach (e.g., appendage or appendage^2^ divided by body size) is often highly correlated with body size [@greenMassLengthResiduals2001; @jakobEstimatingFitnessComparison1996] and thus doesn't provide a good index of body shape. Despite these known biases, ratios are still used to examine changes in animal shape [e.g., @jirinecMorphologicalConsequencesClimate2021; @dubinerWidespreadRecentChanges2022]. 'The OLS residuals' and the 'Body size as a covariate' approaches are very similar, and produce nearly identical results when there is no correlation between predictor variables [body size and temperature increase in the examples above, @freckletonMisuseResidualsEcology2002]. However, as correlation between predictor variables increases 'the OLS residuals' approach becomes increasingly biased [@freckletonMisuseResidualsEcology2002]. Thus, the 'Body size as a covariate' approach has been the most common approach taken in the literature in recent years [e.g., @mcqueenThermalAdaptationBest2022; @rydingLongShorttermResponses2024; @romanoShrinkingBodySize2025].

However, several studies argue that OLS regression is not appropriate for studies of allometric scaling, because it assumes that $X$ is measured with no error and $Y$ contains all the measurement error [@greenMassLengthResiduals2001; @wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006]. This is clearly not the case in studies of relative appendage length, where measurement error is present in both appendage length and body size measurements. Alternative types of regression, like standardized major axis (SMA) regression, are better suited for biological scaling problems as they assume that measurement error is present in both $X$ and $Y$, and thus SMA regression can more accurately estimate the true functional relationship between two variables [@greenMassLengthResiduals2001; @wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006; @peigNewPerspectivesEstimating2009; @peigParadigmBodyCondition2010]. Thus, in the context of testing Allen's rule (i.e., detecting relative changes in appendage length), Santoro & Calzada [-@santoroAllometryEvaluateAllens2022] argued that we must base our methods in allometric scaling theory [although this was contested by @rydingResponseAllometryEvaluate2022]. To date, there is no consensus on which approach most accurately estimates the impact of an increase of temperature on body shape (i.e., relative appendage length).

Here, I evaluate how well two new metrics of relative appendage length, the 'SMA residuals' approach and the 'standardized length index (SLI)', are able to accurately capture changes in relative appendage length due to a simulated temperature increase. The SMA residuals approach uses the residuals from an SMA regression of as an index of relative appendage length, whereas the SLI is based on a modified version of the standardized mass index [@peigNewPerspectivesEstimating2009; @peigParadigmBodyCondition2010], but instead measures how long an organisms appendage is relative to its body size. Hereafter, I will refer to these two approaches as 'SMA approaches', as both leverage SMA regression to generate metrics of relative appendage length. I compare the SMA approaches to the 3 approaches regularly found in the literature. I expect that the SMA approaches will perform better than approaches 1-3 above, as it is based in the principles of allometric scaling theory which is well-suited to answering questions regarding spatial and temporal applications of Allen's rule.

# Background: OLS vs SMA

It is important to understand two different types of regression used in the 3 approaches mentioned above: Ordinary least squares (OLS) & Standardized major axis (SMA) regression. The key difference in these types of regression is how they minimize residuals to generate a line of best fit. The figure below visually depicts the minimization of residuals in OLS (A), MA (B), and SMA (C) regressions [figure from @wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006; refer to this paper for a detailed summary of SMA regression]. You can ignore the MA regression for now.\
\
![Figure from Warton 2006](images/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202025-04-26%20a%20la(s)%2012.08.17.png)\
\
OLS regression minimizes the residuals on the $Y$ axis, whereas SMA regression minimizes the residuals in both $X$ & $Y$ directions. This makes sense for situations where we don't think that $X$ -\> $Y$, but instead just want to understand the relationship between $X$ & $Y$. If this is sounding similar to a principal components (PC) analysis with just 2 variables, you're not wrong – the SMA regression line and the PC1 axis are identical in orientation (slope), but the SMA regression line passes through the means of $X$ and $Y$, whereas PC1 goes through the origin of the centered data (mean = 0). So with only 2 dimensions (e.g., length & mass), they’re just different interpretations of the same line.

## Equations {#sec-equations}

As a reminder, the slope of a variable in OLS regression is:

-   $\beta_{ols} = cov[X] / cov[Y]$ OR equivalently

-   $\beta_{ols} = r * \frac{Sy}{Sx}$ where S is the standard deviation

And the slopes of OLS & SMA regression are also related to each other.

-   $\beta_{sma} = sign(r) * \frac{Sy}{Sx}$ , i.e., if r is negative then $\beta_{sma}$ is also negative.

    This is equivalent to:

$$
\beta_{sma} = \beta_{ols} / r
$$ {#eq-sma-slope}

NOTE:: From the formulas above, we have:

-   $\beta_{sma} = r * \frac{\frac{Sy}{Sx}}{r}$ the rs cancel out, & we have that
-   $\beta_{sma} = \frac{Sy}{Sx}$

## Simulate from MVN

I simulate data for three variables: appendage length, body size, and temperature increase using a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\log(\text{Appendage}) \\
\log(\text{Body size}) \\
\log(\text{Temperature increase})
\end{bmatrix}
\sim \mathrm{MVN}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \Sigma)
$$ {#eq-mvn}

where $\boldsymbol{\mu} = [3,\ 3,\ 3]^\top$ is the mean vector (on the log scale), and $\Sigma$ is the $3 \times 3$ covariance matrix:

$$
\Sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_1^2 & \rho_{12} \sigma_1 \sigma_2 & \rho_{13} \sigma_1 \sigma_3 \\
\rho_{12} \sigma_1 \sigma_2 & \sigma_2^2 & \rho_{23} \sigma_2 \sigma_3 \\
\rho_{13} \sigma_1 \sigma_3 & \rho_{23} \sigma_2 \sigma_3 & \sigma_3^2
\end{bmatrix}
$$ {#eq-cov-mat}

Here, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, and $\sigma_3$ are the standard deviations of $\log(\text{Appendage})$, $\log(\text{Body size})$, and $\log(\text{Temperature increase})$, respectively. The correlation coefficients $\rho_{12}$, $\rho_{13}$, and $\rho_{23}$ control the pairwise associations among these traits. This simulation implies a symmetric, undirected dependence structure — no variable is treated as a causal parent or response. While this simulation strategy does not encode the directional hypothesis of Allen’s rule (i.e., temperature influencing relative appendage length), it avoids biasing the results toward any specific analytical method. For instance, simulating from a linear model such as:

$$
\log(\text{Appendage}) \sim \alpha + \beta_S * \log(\text{Body size}) + \beta_T * \log(\text{Temperature increase}) + \epsilon
$$ {#eq-biased}

would structurally advantage methods that include body mass as a covariate. Likewise, simulating a relationship between temperature and SMA residuals would favor residual-based approaches. By contrast, the MVN simulation provides a methodologically agnostic testbed — all methods start from the same joint distribution, and none are privileged by design.

## Define key functions

The equations in @sec-equations will make more sense as we code some examples. Remember, the correlation structure is specified in the order `(appendage, body size, temperature)`, such that, for example, ρ₁₂ is the correlation between appendage length and body size.\
NOTE:: I sometimes use wing to refer to appendage, and mass to refer to body size – apologies for inconsistency!

### Generate data

```{r}
#| label: Data-generating-function
#| echo: true

# Function to generate datasets
gen_data <- function(b_sma_12 = NULL, r_12, r_13, r_23) {
  Sigma <- gen_3var_cov(b_sma_12, r_12, r_13, r_23)
  data <- mvrnorm(n = 3000, mu = c(3, 3, 3), Sigma = Sigma, empirical = TRUE)
  morph_temp <- tibble(Wing = data[,1], # Wing = appendage
                       Mass= data[,2], # Mass = body size
                       Temp_inc= data[,3])
  
  # Calc std deviations of mass & wing
  sd_mass <- sd(morph_temp$Mass)
  sd_wing <- sd(morph_temp$Wing)
  
  ## Add various sources of error
  # Add measurement error to mass (3%) and wing (1%)
  meas_error_mass <- rnorm(3000, 0, sd = sd_mass * 0.03)
  meas_error_wing <- rnorm(3000, 0, sd = sd_wing * 0.01)
  # Transient fluctuation (biological error) to mass
  transient_error_mass <- rnorm(3000, 0, sd = sd_mass * .1)
  
    morph_temp2 <- morph_temp %>% 
      mutate(Mass = Mass + meas_error_mass + transient_error_mass,
             Wing = Wing + meas_error_wing) %>% 
      mutate(Temp_bin = cut(Temp_inc, breaks = 15, labels = FALSE, 
                            ordered_result = TRUE)) %>%
      arrange(Temp_inc) %>%
      slice_sample(n = 200, by = Temp_bin) %>% 
      mutate(Temp_bin = case_when(
        Temp_bin %in% c(1:4) ~ 4,  
        Temp_bin %in% c(12:15) ~ 12,
        .default = Temp_bin
    ))
    return(morph_temp2)
}
```

### Var-cov matrix for 3 vars

The following function generates a var-cov matrix to produce the desired relationships between appendage, mass, and temperature, as well as the SMA slope between appendage and mass. In other words, this function takes the slopes & correlations that we specify (i.e., b_sma_12, r_12, r_13, r_23) and creates a variance-covariance matrix that will produce data with these relationships. This function is used in the gen_data() function above. (To be honest, I don't have a clear idea of what is going on here var-cov matrix function, but it does seem to work as far as I can tell...).

```{r}
#| label: Function-var-cov
#| echo: true

gen_3var_cov <- function(b_sma_12 = NULL, r_12 = .5, r_13 = 0, r_23 = 0) { 
  if(!is.null(b_sma_12)) { 
    S1 <- abs(b_sma_12) 
  } else { 
      S1 <- 1 
  } 
  S2 <- 1 
  cov_12 <- r_12 * S1 * S2 
  cov_13 <- r_13 * S1 * 1 
  cov_23 <- r_23 * S2 * 1 
  matrix(c(S1^2, cov_12, cov_13, cov_12, S2^2, cov_23, cov_13, cov_23, 1 ), nrow = 3) 
}
```

## Biological realism

While simulating data from a MVN distribution is statistically preferable, it may lack biological realism. Thus, I took the following steps to ensure that the results are biologically relevant.

1.  All simulated variables (i.e., appendage length, body size, temperature increase) all with means of 3, and the generation of the covariance matrix was done for statistical reasons instead of based in biological reality. These are important limitations, but I believe this had to be done to ensure that the simulated data met the statistical requirements (e.g., controlling allometry, effect of temperature on body shape, etc.). I attempted to ensure robustness by conducting a sensitivity analysis, varying some simulation values to be more in line with biological reality. For example, in birds wing values (measured in millimeters) are usually larger than mass (measured in grams) for most species. Thus I also tested more realistic log-scale values for wing, simulating wing with a mean of 5 instead of 3. These simulation results are not shown as results were nearly identical.

2.  I compared the same methods in empirical data from 3 species of nightjars and found that the methods showed the same direction and rank order of effect sizes as in the simulated data (see @sec-case-study).

3.  The simulated ratio of coefficients of variation $\lambda$ in body size ($X$) and appendage length ($Y$) were similar in simulated data sets and the empirical data (see @sec-coef-var).

## Key properties of SMA regression

To illustrate the key properties of SMA regression, let's generate some example data & run some SMA models. We generate an isometric ($\beta_{sma}$ = 0.33) species that becomes relatively 'lankier' with an increase in temperature, i.e. the species decreases more in body size (r_23 = -0.4) relative to appendage length (r_13 = -0.1) for a given increase in temperature.

### Example dataset (lanky)

```{r}
#| label: Ex-df-mods

set.seed(1)
Ex_df_wingy <- pmap(tibble(b_sma_12 = .33, r_12 = .3, r_13 = -.1, r_23 = -.4), gen_data)[[1]]

hist(Ex_df_wingy$Temp_inc)
```

So this tibble contains appendage & body size values from a hypothetical species, as well as simulated amounts of temperature increase. It's important to realize that this is a **single simulation, from a single species** with `r nrow(Ex_df_wingy)` individuals. Down the line we will be simulating roughly 180 datasets (i.e., 180 hypothetical species), each with \~1600 individuals.

```{r}
#| label: Define-sma-or-ma
#| echo: FALSE

sma_or_ma <- "SMA"
```

Use the $smatr$ package [@wartonSmatr3Package2012] to fit an SMA regression model.

```{r}
#| label: Example-SMA-mods

mod_wm <- sma(Wing ~ Mass, data = Ex_df_wingy, method = sma_or_ma)
mod_mw <- sma(Mass ~ Wing, data = Ex_df_wingy, method = sma_or_ma)

mod_ols <- lm(Wing ~ Mass, data = Ex_df_wingy)
size_temp_r <- Ex_df_wingy %>% mutate(res_wm = residuals(mod_wm), 
                                     res_mw = residuals(mod_mw),
                                     ols_r = residuals(mod_ols), 
                                     individual = row_number())
```

### SMA Residuals

One important feature of SMA regression is that it is symmetrical, i.e. the $X$ and $Y$ axes can be flipped and the line of best fit will not change. In the plot below we flip the axes, & plot both the OLS (red) & SMA (blue) regression lines of best fit, as well as an individual from our hypothetical species (highlighted in green). Using the SMA (blue) regression line, you can see that the bird would be described as a relatively short-winged bird for its size in plot (A), or a relatively heavy bird for its wing length in plot (B). These are inverse statements, which make sense for any individual. Comparing the green point to the OLS (red) line, on the other hand, we see that these logical & reciprocal statements do not apply.

```{r}
#| label: SMA-ex

## Can flip axes
Highlight_pt <- size_temp_r %>% 
  filter(Mass > 2.2 & Mass < 2.4) %>% 
  slice_min(res_wm) %>%
  pull(individual)

# Wing ~ mass
w_m <- size_temp_r %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Mass, y = Wing)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .6) +
  geom_point(data = ~filter(.x, individual == Highlight_pt), 
             size = 5, color = "green") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  ggpmisc::stat_ma_line(method = sma_or_ma, color = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Body size", y = "Appendage length")

# Mass ~ wing 
m_w <- size_temp_r %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Wing, y = Mass)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .6) +
  geom_point(data = ~filter(.x, individual == Highlight_pt), 
             size = 5, color = "green") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  ggpmisc::stat_ma_line(method = sma_or_ma, color = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Appendage length", y = "Body size")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-flip-axes
#| fig-cap: One important feature of SMA regression is that the X and Y axes can be flipped and the line of best fit will not change.

ggarrange(w_m, m_w, labels = 'AUTO')
ggsave("Figures/sma_flip_axes.png", bg = "white")
```

Another property of SMA regression is that the residuals are equal & oppositely correlated with both $X$ (body size) & $Y$ (appendage).

```{r}
#| label: SMA-resid-equal-opposite

cor(size_temp_r$Mass, size_temp_r$res_wm)
cor(size_temp_r$Wing, size_temp_r$res_wm)
```

In OLS -- the residuals are not correlated with $X$ & highly correlated with $Y$.

```{r}
#| label: OLS-resid

round(cor(size_temp_r$Mass, size_temp_r$ols_r), 2) # Not correlated
cor(size_temp_r$Wing, size_temp_r$ols_r) # Highly correlated
```

### Relationship with OLS slope & correlation

As I said previously, the SMA line of best fit has a slope equal to the OLS slope divided by the correlation coefficient, i.e. @eq-sma-slope. Let's visualize what this looks like with some example data sets. In the following plots, the blue line is the SMA slope & the red line is the OLS slope.

```{r}
#| label: SMA-vs-OLS-lines

grid_parms <- expand_grid(
  b_sma_12 = c(.2, .33, .5), r_12 = c(.2, .4, .6), r_13 = 0, r_23 = 0
  )
sim_df <- grid_parms %>%
    mutate(coefs = pmap(grid_parms, gen_data)) %>%
    unnest(coefs)

# Plot 3x3 grid 
# Row 1: Hypoallometry, row 2: isometry, row 3: hyperallometry
plot_SMA_grid <- function(sim_data) {
  sim_data %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Mass, y = Wing)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
    # OLS line
    geom_smooth(method = "lm",se = FALSE, color = "red") + #linetype = "dashed"
    # SMA line
    ggpmisc::stat_ma_line(method = sma_or_ma, color = "blue", size = 1) +
    facet_wrap(~condition, scales = "free") +
    labs(x = "Body size", y = "Appendage length")
}
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-3x3-plot

sim_df %>% filter(b_sma_12 == .33) %>%
  mutate(condition = paste0("r = ", r_12)) %>% #"b_sma = ", b_sma_12, ", ", 
  plot_SMA_grid()
#ggsave("Figures/corr_sma_ols_slopes.png", bg = "white")
```

As you can see, for any given allometric scaling relationship there is a bigger mismatch between the OLS & SMA regression lines when there is a low correlation between mass & wing. Indeed, returning to our formula you'll see that the SMA & OLS slopes are identical when r = 1.

$\beta_{sma} = \beta_{ols} / r$ so when r = 1, $\beta_{sma} = \beta_{ols}$

# Simulation

First, determine whether you'd like to constrain the SMA slope to be specific values. This is a step to ensure that setting b_sma values is not biasing our findings -- constraining the SMA values will fix the OLS slopes given the deterministic relationship between b_sma_12, r_12, and b_ols_12. Results are qualitatively similar when the simulated SMA slopes are not set.

```{r}
#| label: Set-b_sma
## Select whether you'd like to constrain the b_sma values or not. 
b_sma <- c(.22, .33, .44) # NULL 

?geom_smooth
```

# Parameter matrix

```{r}
#| label: Define-parameter-matrix

# Create combinations of parameters to run through the extract_coefs() function
Shape <- c("Wingyier", "Proportional", "Fatter")
Shape <- setNames(Shape, Shape)
Parms_mat <- expand_grid(
  b_sma_12 = b_sma,
  r_12 = c(.2, .3, .4), # Wing mass
  r_13 = c(0, -.1, -.25, -.4), # Wing temp
  r_23 = c(0, -.1, -.25, -.4) # Mass temp
  # Effect of temperature on wingyness
) %>% mutate(Temp_eff = case_when( 
  r_13 > r_23 ~ Shape[1], 
  r_13 == r_23 ~ Shape[2], 
  r_13 < r_23 ~ Shape[3]), 
  Strength = abs(r_13 - r_23))
if(!is.null(b_sma)){
  Parms_mat <- Parms_mat %>% mutate(Scaling = case_when(
    b_sma_12 < 0.33 ~ "Hypoallometry", 
    b_sma_12 > 0.33 ~ "Hyperallometry",
    near(b_sma_12, 0.33) ~ "Isometry"
  ))
}
Parms_mat
```

In the parameter matrix we define the relationships we want to simulate — you can think of each row as a hypothetical species that responds differently to increasing temperatures, and in the strength of appendage length–mass covariation. For all species - individuals tend to get smaller (all temperature-morphology correlations are negative), but some species get lankier (i.e., the decrease in body size is greater than the decrease in appendage length), others get fatter, & some species change appendage length & body size proportionally (body shape doesn't change).

To evaluate the methods on a large range of data sets, we also simulate some species that exhibit inverse allometry [as observed in @weeksSharedMorphologicalConsequences2020], where as mass decreases appendage length actually increases (adversarial data sets; [@lotterhosSimulationTestsMethods2022].

           Scaling = factor(Scaling, levels = c("Hypoallometry", "Isometry", "Hyperallometry", "Negative"))) %>%

if(is.null(b_sma)){
  Parms_mat2 <- Parms_mat2 %>% dplyr::select(-b_sma_12)

# Temp impact on body shape: an example

Let's take an example set of parameters that will generate each effect (wingyier, fatter, or proportional). So the following tibble has 3 hypothetical species that respond distinctly to an increase in temperature.

```{r}
#| label: Example-parms

# Hold b_sma & the correlation between wing & mass constant so slopes are roughly the same 
#Filter_parms <- function()

Ex_parms <- Parms_mat2 %>% 
  filter(Scaling == "Isometry") %>%
  slice_max(n = 1, order_by = tibble(Strength), 
            by = Temp_eff, with_ties = FALSE) %>%  #desc(r_13)
  dplyr::select(-Strength)
Ex_parms
```

Next, let's visualize allometric scaling relationships with different amounts of temperature increase. We will use this plot to confirm that our simulations are producing the desired effect: Higher temperatures are causing birds to be proprotionally wingyier, or proportionally fatter, depending on the specified values in the parameter matrix.

First we will define a few important functions.

```{r}
#| label: Prep-data-plotting

# Function to generate example data for plotting
gen_ex_data <- function(Parms_mat){
  Cols <- Parms_mat %>% dplyr::select(starts_with(c("b_", "r_")))
  Parms_mat %>%
    mutate(coefs = pmap(Cols, gen_data)) %>%
    unnest(coefs)
}

# Format 'temperature increase' & 'Temp label' columns
format_sma_parms <- function(sma_mod){
  coef(sma_mod) %>% 
    rownames_to_column("Temp_inc") %>% 
    mutate(
      Temp_inc = str_pad(Temp_inc, side = "left", width = 2, pad = "0"),
      Temp_inc = str_replace(Temp_inc, pattern = "^([0-9])([0-9])$", replacement = "\\1.\\2"),
      Temp_label = paste0(Temp_inc, "°C"), 
      Temp_inc = as.numeric(Temp_inc)) %>%
    tibble() 
}

## Run the SMA models & format output
mod_parms <- map(Shape, \(Sim_shp){
  Ex_df_wingy <- gen_ex_data(Ex_parms) %>% filter(Temp_eff == Sim_shp)
  # Allow slopes to vary or force to remain constant 
  mod_temp_bin <- sma(Wing ~ Mass + Temp_bin, data = Ex_df_wingy, 
                      method = sma_or_ma)
  mod_temp_bin_int <- sma(Wing ~ Mass * Temp_bin, data = Ex_df_wingy, 
                          method = sma_or_ma)
  
  mod_parms <- format_sma_parms(mod_temp_bin) %>% 
    mutate(Slopes_vary = "No")
  mod_parms_int <- format_sma_parms(mod_temp_bin_int) %>% 
    mutate(Slopes_vary = "Yes")
  # Bind tbls together where slopes are held constant or vary
  bind_rows(mod_parms, mod_parms_int)
}) %>% list_rbind(names_to = "Temp_eff")
```

## Temp & body shape plot

The allometric scaling slope determines the rate of increase of the $Y$ variable (appendage length in this case) with an increase in the $X$ variable (body size). The intercept reflects the proportions of the appendage relative to body size such that when slopes are constant, the group with the higher intercept has proportionally larger wings across all body sizes [@shingletonAllometryStudyBiological2010].

So the temperature & body shape plot (@fig-temp-body-shape-plot) confirms that when we simulate birds to get fatter as temperature increases, the wingyiest birds are found at low temperature increases. We find the opposite when we set mass to decrease more than wing length for a given temperature – the wingyiest birds are found at high temperature increases. When the species decreases in size proportionally, note that there is no systematic pattern in the intercepts and the amount of temperature increase. See Figure 4 in Shingleton [-@shingletonAllometryStudyBiological2010] for additional information regarding interpretation of these plots.

```{r}
#| label: fig-temp-body-shape-plot
#| fig-cap: As simulated temperature increases, we simulate birds to get fatter (left panel), wingyier (right panel), or to decrease in size proportionally (center panel). This plot confirms that our simulation has worked as expected.

# Simulate full dataset

Ok! We've confirmed that our functions are working as expected.. Now let's return to the question of interest – Which statistical approach is better at detecting changes in shape as the climate warms?

We simulate data for 180 hypothetical bird species (i.e., every combination of parameters in our parameter matrix) and examine how wing length, an important appendage for thermoregulation [@weeksLongerWingBones2025], changes relative to body mass (a proxy for body size).

```{r}
#| label: Generate-data
#| cache: true

# Simulate data 
Cols <- Parms_mat2 %>% 
  dplyr::select(starts_with(c("b_", "r_"))) 
df_morph_l <- pmap(Cols, gen_data)
```

# Testing assumptions

Both OLS & SMA regression have several assumptions, which are often violated in studies of allometry and can bias results [@greenMassLengthResiduals2001; @wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006; @arnoldAllometricRelationshipSize2007]. For example, both regression approaches make assumptions that $X$ & $Y$ are linearly related to each other, that the residuals are independent, normally distributed, and homoskedastic.

## Homoskedasticity & normality

Plot an example residuals vs fitted plot & an example qq plot to test assumptions of homoskedasticity & normality, respectively. After examining all species (see PDFs), I don't generally see anything particularly concerning, although some residuals vs fitted plots are a little more circular than I am used to seeing (but I don't think we are violating assumptions). I also don't see any major differences between different sets of simulation parameters, so I just show a single example of a residuals vs fitted plot & a qq plot.

## Key question 1:

My interpretation of qq-plots & residual vs fitted plots suggest that the assumptions of SMA regression (table 5, Warton et al 2006) are mostly being met. Do you agree with that? The results do change significantly if I use MA regression.

## SMA-specific assumptions

See Table 5 in Warton et al. @wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006 for a full list of assumptions of SMA regression.

### Assumption of errors

Additionally, SMA regression assumes that error variances of $Y$ and $X$ are proportional to the overall variation in $Y$ and $X$. The $\lambda$ (i.e., the ratio of the errors in $X$ to $Y$) value can be responsible for a large amount of variation that authors attribute to allometric scaling — for example, in a review of allometric scaling studies, Arnold and Green [-@arnoldAllometricRelationshipSize2007] found that 84% of the variation in the allometric slope estimates could be explained by the estimated $\lambda$.

#### Coefficient of variation {#sec-coef-var}

Given that we can't estimate the true errors in $X$ and $Y$ without repeated measurements [@wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006], we can use the coefficient of variations from the empirical data as an estimate [@arnoldAllometricRelationshipSize2007]. "Note that measurement error variance should be estimated on the scale on which the lines are to be fitted" [@wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006]. Arnold and Green [-@arnoldAllometricRelationshipSize2007] second McArdle's (1988) recommendation, that we should use SMA when 1 \< the ratio of errors in Y & X (i.e., $\lambda$) \< 3.

```{r}
#| label: coefficient-variation-function

calc_lambda <- function(x, y){ 
  cv_x <- sd({{ x }}) / mean({{ x }}) 
  cv_y <- sd({{ y }}) / mean({{ y }}) 
  (cv_y^2) / (cv_x^2) } 

lambdas <- map_dbl(df_morph_l, \(df){ 
  df %>% summarize(lambda = calc_lambda(x = Mass, y = Wing)) %>% 
    pull(lambda) %>% 
    round(2)}
  ) 

#range(lambdas)
#mean(lambdas) 
#sd(lambdas)
```

### Key question 2:

We see that the $\lambda$ values between `r min(lambdas)` - `r max(lambdas)` with a mean of `r`mean(lambdas)\`. I interpret this as suggesting that the variance in wing is very low compared to the variance in mass (relative to the mean values), which may very well be true based on other studies examining precision of wing and mass in birds NEED MASS REF [@subasingheRepeatabilityValidityPhenotypic2021]. In this case, do you think it’s still appropriate to use SMA regression (note the $\lambda$ values from the empirical case study of 3 nightjar species, @sec-case-study, are similar)? 

Ok, assuming that the most important assumptions of the different techniques are met, let's move on to comparing how the various approaches perform at recovering the simulated changes in body shape.

# Introducing the SMA approaches

## SMA residuals approach

The 'SMA residuals' approach is very similar to the 'OLS residuals' approach, but instead using the residuals from an SMA regression model. This allows for the empirical estimation of the functional relationship between appendage length and body size, and interprets residuals from this line as an estimate of wingyness.\
Model 1: $SMA(Appendage \sim \mathit{Body\ size})$\
Model 2: $Residuals_{SMA} \sim \mathit{Temperature\ increase}$

## SLI: Standardized length index

Peig & Green [-@peigNewPerspectivesEstimating2009]; [-@peigParadigmBodyCondition2010] revolutionized the way we estimate body condition, using allometric scaling theory to create the standardized mass index [see 3 step process outlined on pages 1886 & 1887 of @peigNewPerspectivesEstimating2009]. We employ a similar process but instead create the standardized length index (SLI), where (appendage) length is on the y-axis. This is very similar to the SMA residuals approach, except that you set the slope $B_{SLI}$ to a value with biological significance. For example, setting $B_{SLI} = 0.33$ compares the appendage length of individual $i$ to a hypothetical species exhibiting isometric scaling with the same body size as individual $i$.

To calculate the SLI for individual $i$ of species $j$, first take the mean of the body size trait in question (e.g., mass) of species $j$, which serves to standardize against the appendage length of individual $i$. We call this $L_0$ as in @peigNewPerspectivesEstimating2009, \[[-@peigParadigmBodyCondition2010]\].\
\
$L_0 = mean(log(\mathit{Body\ size}))$

$SLI_i = \log(\text{Appendage}_i) * \dfrac{L_0}{\log(\text{Body size}_i)^{\beta_{SLI}}}$

Finally, we would model the SLI as a function of temperature increase.

$SLI \sim \mathit{Temperature\ increase}$

Note that setting $B_{SLI} = 0.33$ is similar to the approach taken by Youngflesh et al. [-@youngfleshAbioticConditionsShape2022] in creation of their 'wingyness' index, as they explicitly wanted to capture departures from isometry.

```{r}
#| label: calc-sli-fun

calc_sli <- function(df, b_sli = 0.33, rename_col = FALSE){
  # L0 is the average mass, essentially allowing for comparison of wing lengths for a given mass
  L0 <- mean(df$Mass)
  df_sli <- df %>% mutate(sli = Wing * (L0 / Mass)^b_sli) %>%
  arrange(desc(sli))
  if(rename_col != FALSE){df_sli <- df_sli %>% rename( {{ rename_col }} := sli)}
  return(df_sli)
}
```

  mutate(Model = str_remove_all(Model, "coef_|_app"), 
         Model = str_to_sentence(Model))
```

## Graphical checks

We've simulated data & extracted parameter coefficients for `r nrow(Parms_tbl)` hypothetical species. In the few example species we've looked at, we know that our functions are behaving as expected, but we want to ensure that the simulations behaved as expected for all hypothetical species (i.e., parameter combinations). So we do some graphical checks.

### Check 1

There should be a positive correlation between the binned temperature increase & the intercepts of the SMA regression when we set the simulation to produce wingyier birds at greater temperature increases, & the opposite with fatter birds (as in @fig-temp-body-shape-plot).

```{r}
#| label: fig-cor-allometry-values
#| fig-cap: Despite generating datasets where birds should become fatter or wingyier with increasing temperature (x-axis), when the strength of the difference in the simulated relationships is relatively weak the opposite relationship is observed in rare cases.

# Manipulate tbl for plotting the correlations between the intercepts from SMA models (body shape) and temperature increase
Parms_temp_bs <- Parms_tbl3 %>% filter(Scaling != "Negative") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(cor_allometry, cor_allometry_int), 
               names_to = "SMA_mod", values_to = "Correlation") %>%
  mutate(SMA_mod = if_else(
    SMA_mod == "cor_allometry", "No interaction", "Interaction")
  ) 
Parms_temp_bs_p <- Parms_temp_bs %>% #filter(SMA_mod != "Interaction") %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(Model, b_temp_inc)) %>%
  distinct() 
Parms_temp_bs_p %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Temp_eff, y = Correlation)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed') +
  geom_boxplot(outliers = FALSE) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = .3), alpha = .3, size = 4,
             aes(color = Strength, shape = SMA_mod)) + #
  labs(x = NULL, 
       y = "Correlation temp increase\n and SMA intercepts", 
       title = "Effect of temperature on wingyness")
```

There are a few data sets where the simulated effect of temperature did not have the intended directional effect on body shape, e.g., points in the 'fatter' category that have a positive slope (i.e., points above the dashed line in @fig-cor-allometry-values). These are datasets that had a minor difference between the simulated effect of temperature on wing and mass, and by random chance the directional effect on body shape was the opposite intended.

```{r}
#| label: Remove-incorrect-corr

Sim_fail <- Parms_tbl3 %>% 
  filter(Temp_eff == "Fatter" & cor_allometry_int > 0 | Temp_eff == "Fatter" & cor_allometry > 0 | Temp_eff == "Wingyier" & cor_allometry_int < 0 | Temp_eff == "Wingyier" & cor_allometry < 0)
Parms_tbl4 <- Parms_tbl3 %>% anti_join(Sim_fail)
Sim_fail_uniq <- Sim_fail %>% dplyr::select(-c(Model, b_temp_inc)) %>% 
  distinct()
```

I remove these `r nrow(Sim_fail_uniq)` hypothetical species so the simulated data always matches the desired effect of simulated temperature.

### Check 2

We simulated SMA slopes to be equal to `r b_sma` , and -0.22. This plot shows the estimated SMA slopes from our simulated data.

```{r}
#| label: fig-SMA-slopes-maintained
#| fig-cap: We set the SMA slopes in our simulation -- ensure that these slopes were recovered.

# Ensure that the SMA scaling relationships were maintained during simulation
if(!is.null(b_sma)){
  Parms_tbl4 %>% ggplot(aes(x = Scaling, y = est_b_sma, color = Scaling)) + 
    geom_boxplot(outliers = FALSE) + 
    geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = .1), color = "black", 
               alpha = .5) + 
    theme(legend.position = "top") + 
    labs(x = NULL, y = "Estimated SMA slope")
}
```

After our graphical checks, I feel more confident that the simulation is doing what I think it is. Now let's move onto the question of interest... How do the SMA approaches compare to the approaches regularly used in the literature (i.e., OLS residuals, 'including mass as a covariate', & ratio approaches) at recovering the true relationship of increasing temperature on body shape?

## 5 approaches plot

The 5 approaches (2 SMA approaches, 3 traditional approaches) are all interested in accurately estimating $\beta_T$ from @eq-beta1-5-approaches.

$$
Wingyness \sim \alpha + \beta_T * \mathit{Temperature\ increase}
$$ {#eq-beta1-5-approaches}

The difference in the 5 approaches (note that Wing / mass and Wing² / mass are both 'ratio approaches') is how wingyness is measured (as outlined in @sec-Conceptual-background). Note that the 'body size as a covariate' approach would also contain $\beta_2 * \mathit{Body\ size}$ in @eq-beta1-5-approaches.

### Positive allometry

### Inverse allometry

We also wanted to challenge these methods with datasets that are less common but biologically plausible. Thus, we examine hypothetical species exhibiting negative allometric scaling, i.e., where wing length increases when mass decreases, or viceversa.

```{r}
#| label: fig-negative-allometry
#| fig-cap: When species exhibit inverse allometry, a temperature increase results in species increasing in wing and decreasing in mass. These species are clearly much wingyier, yet several of the approaches (importantly, the SMA residuals approach) fail to detect the increase in wingyness. Note that the the y-limits are truncated at -0.25, 0.25 to improve visibility, but the ratio methods have some extreme estimates in both the positive and negative directions.

Parms_tbl4 %>%
  plot_approaches(negative = TRUE, ylim = TRUE)
```

# Evaluation

We can visually see that certain approaches appear to produce more accurate classifications, but let's make visualization more explicit.

#| label: prep-eval-figs

# Case study: Wing shape in migratory nightjars {#sec-case-study}

Let's examine how shape changes in a real data set of 3,272 individuals from three nightjar species collected across a latitudinal / temperature gradient by Skinner et al. (2025, *in press*). Skinner et al. (2025) found that all three species follow Bergmann's rule when examining two mettarics of body size: wing length and body mass. These authors also examined allometric scaling and found that European nightjars exhibit isometric scaling ($\beta_{SMA}$ = 0.33) between wing length and body mass, whereas nighthawks and whip-poor-wills exhibit hyperallometric scaling ($\beta_{SMA}$ = 0.44 and $\beta_{SMA}$ = 0.40, respectively). However, Skinner et al. (2025) did not examine how temperature influences body shape in nightjars.. Let's apply our methods to this data set.

First, examine $\lambda$, the ratio of coefficient of variations in wing & mass, from our empirical data (@tbl-cv-nightjars).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-cv-nightjars
#| tbl-cap: The ratio of coefficients of variation (lambda) in wing & mass in 3 nightjar species. Empirical data from Skinner et al. (2025).

cv_tab <- structure(list(Species = c("Nightjar", "Whip-poor-will", "Nighthawk"
), N = c(2416L, 535L, 321L), lambda = c(0.08, 0.16, 0.13)), row.names = c(NA, 
-3L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"))
cv_tab %>% gt() 

```

These low $\lambda$ values are similar to what we observed in our simulated data above, providing additional evidence that our simulated data are biologically plausible. The low $\lambda$ values suggest that the variance in wing is very low compared to the variance in mass (relative to the mean values).

For now, we just read in 'Nightjar_shape.png' with the results that we ran in a different R project (@fig-nightjar-shape-shifting).

```{r}
#| label: fig-nightjar-shape-shifting
#| fig-cap: The approach we use to quantify body shape greatly influences our biological conclusions. Points represent the mean parameter estimates and error bars represent 95% confidence interval (using the standard error). A positive slope means that birds get wingyer as temperature increases, and a negative slope means that birds get fatter as temperature increases. We observe the same qualitative pattern as in our simulation study. 

Nj_shape_img <- readPNG("Figures/Nightjar_shape.png")
Nj_shape_grob <- rasterGrob(Nj_shape_img, width = 1, height = 1)

ggdraw(Nj_shape_grob)
```

We observe the same rank order pattern that we observed in our simulation study! Relative to the SMA approaches, the 'mass as a covariate' approach is negatively biased and the ratio approaches are positively biased in all three species. Biological conclusions vary greatly depending on the approach used – in fact, we conclude that all three species are getting wingyier if we use the Wing / mass ratio, and we conclude that all three species are getting fatter if we use the mass as a covariate approach. Given that our simulation study showed that the SMA residuals approach produced unbiased estimates of wingyness (as long as the species exhibited positive allometric scaling), I conclude that, with warmer temperatures, nighthawks get wingyer, nightjars get fatter, and whip-poor-wills decrease in size roughly proportionally.

Importantly, the ratio approaches have very high correlations with mass (e.g., Wing / Mass correlations \< -0.9), thus it is not surprising that there are large positive effects of $\beta$ temperature on body shape (given that all three species follow Bergmann's rule). Squaring wing (Wing^2^ / mass) reduced correlation with mass (between -0.81 \< $r$ \< -0.66 for the 3 species), suggesting it may be a more effective indicator of shape. Wing^2^ / mass also has more theoretical support as a proxy for the surface area to volume ratio (a squared to a cubic ratio). The residuals from the SMA model were equally and oppositely correlated with mass and wing (between 0.52 \> \|$r$\| \> 0.63 for the 3 species).

# Discussion

Wow! We see that the SMA approaches do a better job at identifying the correct relationship with changes in temperature.

1.  The SLI approach correctly estimates the direction of the simulated effect when temperature increases relative appendage length (i.e., a positive $\beta_T$ in @fig-compare-approaches; 'Wingyier' and 'Much wingyier' in the @fig-eval), but incorrectly estimates the direction of the simulated effect in about `r Sli_fatter_wrong`% of hypothetical species when temperature decreases relative appendage length (i.e., 'fatter' species). In species that were simulated as decreasing in size proportionally, the SLI approach misclassifies about `r Dif_sli`% of hypothetical species as getting Wingyier that in reality decreased in relative appendage length (@fig-eval panel b). That being said, it correctly classified all species exhibiting inverse allometry. Thus, the SLI approach appears flexible and generalizeable, but positively biased in situations that are likely common in the real world (e.g., that species decrease in size proportionally with climate warming).

    1.  The 'SMA residuals' approach correctly estimates the direction of the simulated effect when the species exhibit positive allometry 100% of the time, but misidentifies the relationship `r Sma.res_much.wingyier_wrong`% of the time when species exhibit inverse allometry ('Much wingyier' in the @fig-eval). The SMA residuals approach appears to be unbiased when there is no effect of temperature on body shape, as it estimates a positive effect in about 50% of the simulated hypothetical species (@fig-eval panel b). Thus, the 'SMA residuals' approach appears to provide the best indicator of wingyness in species that exhibit positive allometry, which is very common in biology [@shingletonAllometryStudyBiological2010; @youngfleshAbioticConditionsShape2022].

The 'mass as a covariate' approach has been advocated for [@rydingResponseAllometryEvaluate2022] by authors in recent years, and was the most commonly utilized approach to quantify relative appendage length in our literature review [e.g., @rydingLongShorttermResponses2024; @mcqueenThermalAdaptationBest2022]. However, I found that it returns negatively biased estimates of temperature's impact on wingyness ($\beta_T$ in @eq-beta1-5-approaches), to where:

1.  it only detects the appropriate change in birds that are getting wingyier a little more than half the time (`r Ryding_much.wingyier_right`% and `r Ryding_wingyier_right`% for hypothetical species simulated to get 'Much wingyier' and 'Wingyier', respectively, in @fig-eval panel a).

2.  it misidentifies birds that we simulated to decrease in mass and wing proportionally as getting fatter with increasing temperatures (a `r Dif_ryding`% overestimation; @fig-eval panel b).

There are at least two things that I believe are causing the SMA approaches to outperform the OLS and ratio approaches...

## 1. Absolute appendage length

The 'body size as a covariate' approach claims that by including a metric of body size as a predictor, we are now measuring the impact of temperature on the proportional change in size of the response variable (i.e., wing length in this case). But in reality we are still measuring the impact of body size and temperature on absolute (not relative) appendage length. Let's examine this more formally from a causal modeling framework. When both Bergmann's and Allen's rules apply, we expect temperature to have causal effects on both appendage length and body size. While most biologists would agree that body size does not *cause* appendage length, the model $Appendage \sim \beta_T * \mathit{Temperature\ increase} + \beta_S * Size$implicitly treats body size as a causal predictor of appendage length. This corresponds to the following directed acyclic graph (DAG):

```{r}
#| label: fig-DAG
#| fig-cap: The directed acyclic graph (DAG) implied by the 'body size as a covariate' approach. 

library(dagitty)
library(ggdag)

# Specify DAG
dag_allen <- dagify(
  Appendage ~ Size + Temperature,
  Size ~ Temperature,
  exposure = c("Temperature"), 
  outcome = "Appendage",
  labels = c("Temp" = "Temperature")
)

# More complex DAG acknowledging latent variable size
# Error terms (not included explicitly): measurement error, transient biological error
dag_allen2 <- dagify(
  Mass ~ Size + Temp,
  Appendage ~ Size + Temp,
  Size ~ Temp,
  latent = "Size",
  exposure = "Temp",
  outcome = "Appendage",
  labels = c("Temp" = "Temperature", "Size" = "Latent Body Size")
)

# Adjustment set 
adjustmentSets(dag_allen, type = "minimal", effect = "direct") 

# Plot
tidy_dagitty(dag_allen, layout = "fr") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text_col = "black",
               text = TRUE, 
               edge_type = "link_arc",
               node_size = 20,
               text_size = 3, 
               stylized = TRUE) + 
  theme_dag() + 
  guides(fill = "none", color = "none")
```

If our goal is to estimate the effect of temperature on relative appendage length, we hope that $\beta_T$ captures that. But conditioning on size removes the indirect path from temperature to appendage length that operates via changes in body size. The result is that $\beta_T$ estimates the direct effect of temperature on absolute appendage length, not relative shape. So when both Bergmann’s and Allen’s rules apply, i.e. when increasing temperatures reduce both body size and appendage length, this model often yields a negative estimate of $\beta_T$, even in cases where appendages become relatively longer (species below the dashed line in the 'wingyier' panel in @fig-compare-approaches). The sign and magnitude of $\beta_T$ will depend on the relative strength of the two causal paths, $Temperature \rightarrow Appendage$ and $Temperature \rightarrow Size$ (‘Strengths’ in @fig-compare-approaches).

## 2. SMA \> OLS regression

The other thing that may be occurring is that OLS regression is fundamentally not the appropriate type of regression for allometric relationships.

ggarrange(hypo_p, hyper_p, common.legend = TRUE)

#hyper_p
#ggsave("Figures/fig-underestimation-ral.png", bg = "white")
```

While the approach advocated for by Ryding et al [-@rydingResponseAllometryEvaluate2022] does not leverage the residuals from the OLS regression directly, it does use an OLS line-fitting approach where wing size is controlled for by mass. Thus, the above plot is useful in developing some intuition for why the 'SMA residuals' approach does a better job at detecting the true relationship between an increase in temperature & the change in proportional wing size. The OLS regression always underestimates the slope of the true relationship between mass & wing. This leads to an overestimation of negative residuals in small individuals (i.e., points in the bottom left quadrant of the plot - labeled with a black "I"), and an overestimation of positive residuals in large individuals (top right quadrant of the plot - labeled with a black "II"). If we assume that the temporal analogs of Allen's & Bergmann's rule apply to most species, then temperature increases will push individuals towards the bottom left quadrant of the plot – exactly where OLS overestimates the negative residuals! In other words, OLS suggests that the individuals in Section I are relatively fat (i.e., negative residuals), whereas SMA correctly labels them as wingy. We see the inverse bias in Section II.

# When is the SMA residuals approach NOT the best choice?

There are cases when including covariates in an OLS model may be required, or may perform better than using the residuals from SMA regression as our metric of shape.

## Negative allometric scaling

As noted previously, when there is negative allometric scaling, i.e., wing length increases when mass decreases, the SMA residuals approach often does not identify the increase in wingyness (@fig-negative-allometry). Surprisingly, **only the SLI approach returns the correct estimated direction of effect in all cases,** and the ratio approaches return the correct direction of the simulated effect about 85% of the time. Surprisingly, the approaches based on OLS don't perform very well, as they return negatively biased estimates of $\beta_T$ in @eq-beta1-5-approaches in many of the 180 hypothetical species. We believe this is due to a 'supression' effect, resulting from collider bias (i.e. conditioning on a negatively correlated mediator like body size in this case). In short, the positive effect of Temp_increase → Relative appendage is overwhelmed by the path Temp_increase → Body size → Relative appendage, where a temperature increase decreases body size, and body size and appendage length are negatively correlated (i.e., there is inverse allometry). inverse allometry is not particularly common in nature, although has been observed in rare cases [e.g. @weeksSharedMorphologicalConsequences2020]. This only occurs with certain hypothetical species' parameter combinations, and more research is needed.

```{r}
#| label: Parm-collider-bias
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

Parms_tbl5 %>% filter(Temp_eff == "Much wingyier" & Est_correct == FALSE) %>% 
  dplyr::select(b_sma_12, r_12, r_13, r_23, Strength) %>% 
  distinct() 
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-neg-allometric-temp_wingy
#| fig-cap: Hypothetical species exhibiting inverse allometry. The SMA residual approach does not capture the relationship between an increase in temperature and relative appendage length. 

Ex_parms_neg <- Parms_mat2 %>% 
  filter(Scaling == "Negative" & Strength == 0.8) %>%
  slice_max(n = 1, order_by = Strength, by = Temp_eff, with_ties = FALSE)
Ex_df_neg <- gen_ex_data(Ex_parms_neg)

plot_allo_temp(df = Ex_df_neg)
```

## Violation of assumptions in SMA regression

The SMA approaches are inflexible in their ability to customize models. This is because SMA approaches can only model the two scaling variables $X$ and $Y$ (at least in R packages that can conduct SMA regression, e.g. `smatr`).

### Non-linearity between X and Y

For example, if after log-log transforming the linear & volumetric measurement there is still not **a linear relationship**, the SMA assumption of linearity (that $Y$ & $X$ are linearly related) is violated, and it would be prudent to compare linear vs non-linear (e.g., $\mathit{Body\ size} + \mathit{Body\ size^2}$) models, as was done in Baldwin et al. [-@baldwinComplementarityAllensBergmanns2023]. In this case the 'covariate in OLS regression' approach may be preferred.

### Heteroskedasticity due to missing covariates

A second case where it may be advisable to use the 'covariate in OLS regression' approach is if your SMA model shows severe heteroskedasticity due to missing covariates. For example, let's say we are trying to understand shape-shifting in a bird species that moves through thick underbrush and experiences severe flight feather wear throughout the year after its annual molt. You may want to control for this flight feather wear by including the date of capture in our model examining wingyness, but this isn't possible in SMA regression, i.e. $Appendage \sim \mathit{Temperature\ increase} + Date + \mathit{Body\ size}$ is not a feasible model in SMA regression. Including date of capture (or feather wear directly) directly in the model using the SMA residuals ($Residuals_{SMA} \sim \mathit{Temperature\ increase} + Date$) is an option, but more study is needed.

# Final recommendations

As suggested by previous authors [@wartonBivariateLinefittingMethods2006; @greenMassLengthResiduals2001], SMA regression can improve our inference in studies involving biological scaling. SMA assumes that the error variance in $X$ and $Y$ are equivalent, which makes more biological sense than assuming all error is in the $Y$ variable, as in OLS regression. However, the assumption of equal error variance may not always be reasonable, so another option is to directly model $X$ and some error $\sigma_x$ in $X$. Suppose we have repeat measurements $j$ of a morphological trait $X$ for individual $i$, denoted $X_{ij}$. These can be used to estimate the within-individual measurement error, $\sigma_{x,\text{within}}$, and — by comparing to the total observed variance — to infer the between-individual variance, $\sigma_{x,\text{between}}$.

$$
X_{i,j} \sim N(X_{obs} ; \sigma^2_{x, within})
$$

$$
Var(X_{i,j}) = \sigma^2_{x, within} + \sigma^2_{x, between}
$$

From here, we can model each individual’s true latent trait value $X_{\text{true},i}$ as coming from a normal distribution with population-level mean of the true values of $X$, $\mu_x$, with variance $\sigma^2_{x,between}$. We can then estimate the scaling relationship ($\beta_1$) between $X$ and a response variable $Y$, while accounting for the measurement uncertainty in $X$.

$$
X_{true,i} \sim N(\mu_x ; \sigma^2_{x, between})
$$

$$
Y_i \sim N(\alpha + \beta_{1} * X_{true,i};  \sigma^2_y)
$$

Note, if we have repeat measurements of our response variable $Y$, we can also model this as in @eq-repeat-measure-x, permitting the decomposition of $\sigma^2_y$ into residual variance ($\sigma^2_{y,residual}$) and measurement error ($\sigma^2_{y,within}$), although this is generally less important as unmodeled measurement error in $Y$ will not bias $\beta_1$. Hierarchical measurement-error models can be fit in a Bayesian or maximum likelihood framework, and these models can be directly extended to include additional biological complexity (e.g., phylogenetic or random effects, spatial or temporal autocorrelation, etc.).

However, repeat morphological measurements are rarely collected in ecology, and without them $\sigma_{x,between}$ and $\beta_1$ are not separately identifiable. That being said, there are still other options that will provide more biologically plausible results than assuming no measurement error in $X$.

-   Fix $\sigma_{x,\text{within}}$ to a plausible value based on expert judgment or prior studies (e.g., 1%, 5%, or 10% of the trait mean). When introducing this kind of subjectivity, a sensitivity analysis is essential to evaluate the robustness of $\beta_1$ to the assumed error magnitude.

-   In a Bayesian context, specify priors on $\sigma_{x,\text{within}}$ and $\sigma_y$, allowing the data and prior information to jointly inform their posterior distributions.

We recognize that modeling $X_{true}$ as latent may be beyond the statistical understanding or time constraints of many people. Thus, we suggest that the SMA approaches are an adequate second choice. The 'SMA residuals' approach performs the best as long as the species exhibits positive allometry (better than the SLI approach). The SLI appears to be more generalizeable, as it correctly estimates the direction of the simulated effect even on species exhibiting inverse allometry (although SLI appears positively biased overall). In just a few lines of code, users can have a biologically principled and tested estimate of body shape.

The biological world is complex, and our statistical approaches to handle this complexity have improved greatly in recent decades. For example, our literature review shows that most studies in recent years examined Allen's rule across groups of species, and that models accounting for phylogenetic relationships (e.g., PGLMM) were the most frequently employed model. We highlight that the SMA approaches could easily be generated for an unlimited number of species as long as they are done in a species-specific manner. The output from either of the SMA approaches could then be used as the response variable in a model accounting for phylogenetic relatedness.

No need to continue on... Thanks for reading!

# Still to do

-   Understand how allometric scaling influences response in the different approaches. When correlation between mass & temp is \< -.4, hyperallometric individuals show the strongest response, but when correlation = -.7 it is much more variable – why?

    -   Change SLI to SLI

    -   SMA residuals not valid, as they are taken orthogonally to line of best fit. Thus, update SMA residuals approach to be two versions of SLI, using the estimated Bsma or setting Bsma = 0.33

    -   See three advantages of SMI over OLS residuals in Peig & Green (2009), this has been validated in SMI context (as corresponding to the true metric of interest), which is a big advantage. SMI is highly correlated (but not identical) to OLS residuals

        -   Maintains units of original variable

        -   Accounts for power law relationship, ie multiplicative instead of additive error function

        -   Comparable across populations within the same species

    -   Returning to the faceted plot comparing a hyper- & hypo- allometric species (@fig-allometric-relationship-temp-wingy), we can also see that hyperallometric species have the strongest response, irrespective of whether an increase in temperature makes organisms fatter or wingyier. While it's true that a given change in wing or mass will produce a larger change in the other variable due to the steeper slope exhibited in hyperallometric species, I thought fitting the SMA line of best fit would largely remove the effect of scaling. Thus, I thought the SMA residuals approach would show similar results irrespective of the simulated scaling relationship.

        -   The pattern of stronger residual–temperature effects in hyperallometric species is likely a **consequence** of how covariances are structured in this simulation. I don't think that this reflects a true biological phenomena, but a *mathematical property* of the multivariate normal distribution under the simulated covariances.

        -   Think of each species’ cloud of points like a cigar. The SMA line goes along the long axis of the cigar. But if an increase in temperature “pushes” the whole cigar diagonally — and more so for hyperallometric species — then the **residuals (shortest distance to the** SMA line of best fit**)** will stretch out more along the temperature gradient. That’s why we see a stronger correlation between temp & the residuals (wingyness) in a hyperallometric species.

    -   Steeper SMA line -\> greater residuals? Correlation & b_ols slope..

-   Run with MA instead of SMA

    -   SMA is essentially like running scale(log_wing) \~ scale(log_mass) and then backtransforming

    -   MA regression does change the results, it seems negatively biased along with the Ryding approach, but several sources suggest that SMA regression is the approach that makes the most sense (Warton, 2006; Peig & Green, 2009). So don't worry about MA for now.

-   Case study

    -   Include 2 SMA lines of best fit in real data and compare to mass + sex (or age) + temp increase

    -   Create Temp & body shape plot

    -   Check residual vs fitted, qq plots to ensure we meet assumptions of SMA regression

-   How will we evaluate these different methods? Could AUC-ROC be viable? Note an AUC-ROC of 0.5 is expected by chance

-   Challenge with 'adversarial data sets' (e.g., inverse allometry)

## To consider:

There are certainly more complete & time-intensive approaches for measuring shape in ecology e.g.,

-   Landmark analysis (Bookstein, 2013).

-   Measurements of bones

-   Functional trait space where each point is an individual (I haven't seen this in the literature though)

How can we make a size index? How does this differ from the SMI? Do we want a shape index or a size index?

-   Compare this approach to the SMI approach... Are they perfectly correlated?

Box-cox to understand the parameter of the Box-Cox power transformation?

While some authors have used raw appendage size to test Allen's rule [e.g., @fanBergmannsRuleAllens2019], I would argue that most appendages this is a better test of Bergmann's rule in most cases [although organs tightly tied to thermoregulation may be an exception for some species and contexts - bird bills: @tattersallEvolutionAvianBill2017; @symondsGeographicalVariationBill2010; elephant ears: CITE]. In studies of Allen's rule, I argue that tying multiple metrics together at the level of the individual is critical.

Allen's rule is often interpreted as appendage length *relative* to body size, which acknowledges that overall body size and appendage length will generally show positive covariance due to principles of biological scaling [@shingletonAllometryStudyBiological2010]. In fact, interpreting Allen's rule as relative appendage length is the only way that Bergmann's and Allen's rules can be true simultaneously for a species exhibiting positive allometry (i.e., body size and appendage size positively covary). For the rest of this section, I will refer to body size as mass (although as noted above there are many metrics that can approximate body size), as this is the metric commonly used to represent body size in studies of Allen's rule. Positive allometry is very common in nature, as larger organisms tend to weigh more and require longer appendages to transport this increased weight. For example, lift in bird wings is FILL IN and thus the laws of physics tend to result in species with positive allometry [@raynerFormFunctionAvian1988].

To examine *relative* appendage length, authors must compare a given appendage relative to a metric of body size for each individual. This has been done in several ways, including (1) modeling simple ratios (e.g., appendage:mass) as a function of temperature, (2) modeling appendage length as a function of body size and temperature, and (3) conducting a two-step regression by (3a) modeling appendage length as a function of mass using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and then (3b) modeling the residuals as a function of temperature. In the next section we discuss these three approaches and make our case as to why we believe t
