  Ecogeographical rules such as Bergmann’s and Allen’s have long guided expectations about how organismal size and shape vary across temperature gradients. Yet these rules are typically tested independently, despite sharing a common thermoregulatory basis. Here, I synthesize recent empirical literature to evaluate how often Bergmann’s and Allen’s rules are analyzed jointly and assess what is lost when size and shape are studied in isolation. A review of 86 studies published since 2021 reveals that only half examine both rules together, although far fewer test for co-dependence between the rules. I argue that isolated rule testing obscures three processes that link size and shape and structure thermoregulatory adaptation. First, trade-offs arise when functional or life-history constraints limit responses in one trait, shifting adaptive change to another. Second, complementarity occurs when coordinated but modest changes in size and shape together produce meaningful adjustments to surface area–to–volume ratios, even when neither trait shows a strong independent signal. Third, interactions emerge when the effect of temperature on one trait depends on the state of another, leading to context-dependent or even inverse patterns that contradict simple rule-based expectations. 
  
  These same principles extend beyond morphology. Physiological regulation, coloration, phenology, and behavior frequently interact with body size and shape to determine the thermal environments organisms experience. Focusing narrowly on single traits risks mischaracterizing adaptive pathways and underestimating organismal flexibility under climate change. I propose a Thermo-Morpho framework that treats size and shape as complementary axes of thermoregulatory adaptation while explicitly linking them to their shared biophysical basis. I then situate morphology within a broader Thermo-Adaptive perspective that considers how physiology, coloration, behavior, and phenology also contribute to thermal balance. Together, these ideas argue for moving beyond single-rule analyses towards integrative responses to climatic warming.
